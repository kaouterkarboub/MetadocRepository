# MetadocRepository
This repository is a go through steps for Metadoc Updated Solutions
This repository contains two different updates for Metadoc Solutions: 

1. Full Body Posture assessment
2. Seated person assessment based on videos

The above solutions contain the following docs for each: 
a. Code for the solution 
b. Resources to run code (from the original format to used format) 
c. doc file to explain how to run the code and use the resources. 
d. Results after running code

Steps to Run a code: 

Go to Link : https://colab.research.google.com/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Then upload the resources to your workspace as mentionned:

Once you ve uploaded the resources, make sure the ID of the resource is same as mentioned in code, run cells sequentially.

YOU CAN REPRODUCE THE RESULTS. 


2. SEated assessment based on video frames: 

Code for this solution: 
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UsWiGpAVA_NO7Xxv7He3AuHUx609ZsU9?usp=sharing 

We got Videos from: https://www.istockphoto.com/ 

Converted videos to mp4 format and adjusted resolution to have better results. 

Corrected code to take into account angle from where we are taking the videos. 

Tested the code with 5 videos of different durations, angles and visibility levels. 

For speed processing and robust processing video frames should exceed 20MB.

After Running the code You will the videos (original, converted, and results included) in this Drive Link:
